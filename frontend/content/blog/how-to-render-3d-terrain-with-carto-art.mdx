Flat maps are fine, but there's something captivating about seeing mountains rise from the page. With Carto Art's 3D terrain rendering, you can transform any location into a dramatic landscape that reveals the true character of the land. This guide walks you through the entire process, from opening the editor to exporting a print-ready masterpiece.

## Getting Started

Open the Carto Art editor and search for a location with interesting topography. Mountain ranges, coastal cliffs, and river valleys all work beautifully. For this tutorial, we're working with a mountainous region where the elevation changes will really shine.

## Configuring Display Options

Before adding dimension, set up your map's annotations. Open the **Annotations** tab and expand **Display Options**. Toggle off the **Title**, **Subtitle**, and **Coordinates** if you want a cleaner look that lets the terrain speak for itself. For this design, we're keeping the map minimal and letting the topography take center stage.

## Choosing a Color Theme

Color choice dramatically affects how terrain reads. Navigate to the color palette menu and browse the available themes. We're using **Navy & Cream** here because its high contrast makes elevation changes pop, but earthy tones and monochromatic schemes also work well for terrain-focused designs.

## Enabling 3D Terrain

This is where the transformation happens. Open the **Details & 3D** section and start by cranking up the quality:

1. Set quality to **Ultra** for the sharpest terrain mesh.
2. Push **Tile Detail** to **4x** so ridgelines and valleys render crisply.

Now flip on **Volumetric 3D Terrain**. Watch as the flat plane lifts into three dimensions, revealing every contour of the landscape. For this design, disable **3D Terrain Shadows** to keep the look clean and graphic. Without shadows, the terrain reads as a stylized relief map rather than a realistic rendering—perfect for minimalist aesthetics.

## Adding the Final Frame

Navigate to **Backdrop & Readability** for the finishing touch. While you can add a text backdrop for better legibility over complex terrain, we're adding a **Frame** instead. Adjust the slider until the frame width complements your composition without crowding the map edges.

## The Final Result

Right-click and drag to rotate your view. Tilt the perspective, spin it around, and watch how light plays across the terrain from different angles. What started as a flat rendering is now a sculptural representation of the landscape, ready to export and print at any size.
